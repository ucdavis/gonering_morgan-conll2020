# gonering_morgan-conll2020
All code for Gonering &amp; Morgan (2020), "Uniform processing difficulty is a poor predictor of cross-linguistic word order frequency", to be presented at CoNLL.

The analysis folder contains R code used to analyze the raw results from the code contained in the uid folder, including the statistical tests used in the paper and the code used to generate all figures.

The uid folder contains two subfolders:
    -the R subfolder contains the R code used in our attempted replication of Maurits, Navarro, and Perfors (2010)'s toyworld; and
    -the Java subfolder itself contains three subfolders:
        --the WordOrder folder contains the Java project code used in our attempted replication of MNP (2010)'s toyworld, our attempted replication of MNP (2010)'s child-directed speech corpus results, and our expansion to Universal Depedencies v. 2.5 derived corpora;
        --the CHILDES folder contains the Java project code used to construct our event dataset from the Brown corpus of child-directed speech; and
        --the UD extraction folder contains the Java project code used to construct our event dataset from 20 languages in the UD project v. 2.5.

The ReformatUIDmetadata folder contains Java project code to reformat the metadata generated by the UD extraction code. This format of the metadata is more conducive for the analysis R code.
